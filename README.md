# Implementation of Byzantine Robustness over a Network Layer

Implemented as a part of academic project, under `Prof. Haibin Zhang in CMSC-626 (Principles of Computer Security)`

This project aims to simulate a network with byzantine faults and overcome them using protocol defined in `Network Layer protocols with Byzantine Robustness, Radia Perlman`
